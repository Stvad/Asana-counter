## How to use:
Get Greasemonkey (or Tampermonkey if you use Chrome)  plugin;

Install the script;

Reload the Asana;

You're good to go :).

Select some tasks. If they have numbers in square brackets in them - the numbers will be summed up and displayed on the right panel.
Examples of expected numbers format in tasks:

- task [42]

- task[3.14]

- [-1] task
